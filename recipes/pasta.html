        <p class="description">
    This is a beef pasta cooked with Italian seasonings in a creamy tomato sauce. The epitome of easy homemade comfort food with the convenience of one pot cooking!
        </p>
        <h2 class="description-title">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="simple-text">
        <li><strong>Beef mince(ground beef)</strong>: I use lean here (90% or 95%) but any fat % will do. Actually, the fattier the beef, the beefier the flavour â€“ because fat is where all the flavour is! If you mix, say, lamb fat into very lean beef mince and cook it up, youâ€™d swear youâ€™re eating lamb. ðŸ™‚</li>
        <li><strong>Chicken stock/broth</strong>: The cooking liquid of choice. Tastier than water! I use the liquid cartons regularly in my cooking so I stock up when itâ€™s on sale. For an economical option, I recommend using Vegeta stock powder or Chinese chicken stock powder (Knorr) plus water. I prefer the flavour of these over other Western stock powders.</li>
        <li><strong>Pasta type</strong>: I used the spirals (fusilli), but other similar sized short pastas will work just fine too. Penne, ziti, elbow macaroni, shells. Avoid the really small pastas like risoni/orzo, tiny stars etc. If using long pasta, itâ€™s easiest to break in half. You can also use a little more â€“ increase up to about 400g/14oz.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream</strong>: Just 3/4 cup, stirred in right at the end transforms a normal tomato sauce into a creamy tomato sauce! You really do only need 3/4 cup to get the flavour and colour impact of the creaminess.</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic and onion</strong>: Essential flavour base.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato paste and canned tomato</strong>: Tomato paste gives a boost to the tomato flavour as well as thickening the sauce a touch.</li>
        <li><strong>Italian herbs</strong>: Seasoning! I use a store bought mix, itâ€™s a staple in the dried herbs and spices aisle at any grocery store and doesnâ€™t cost any more than other dried herbs. If you donâ€™t have it, use any mix of dried oregano, basil and parsley. Or, a dash of Worcestershire sauce. Just something to add flavour.</li>
        <li><strong>Red pepper flakes (chilli flakes)</strong>: 100% optional. I like to add a tiny touch of warmth into this to keep things interest but you can just leave it out if you prefer!</li>
    </ul>
        <h2 class="description-title">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="simple-text">
        <li><strong>Cook beef</strong>: SautÃ© the garlic and onion. Then add the beef and cook, breaking it up as you go, until you no longer see red.</li>
        <li><strong>Toast seasoning</strong>: Add the Italian herbs then cook for 30 seconds. This really brings out the flavour of the herbs and spices, and improves the flavour by toasting it. Then add the tomato paste and stir for a minute. This cooks out the rawness and also improves the flavour.</li>
        <li><strong>Add liquids and pasta</strong>: Add the stock, canned tomato, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Give it a good stir, then add the pasta.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook 15 minutes</strong>: Once the liquid comes back up to a simmer, cook for 15 minutes until the pasta is just about cooked. Stir every couple of minutes at the start then more regularly towards the end to ensure the pasta doesnâ€™t stick to the base of the pot. As you cook, the liquid will reduce and thicken but should still be soupier than youâ€™d expect.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream it!</strong>: Stir in the cream, bring it back up to a simmer then keep cooking for another minute until the pasta is fully cooked. It should still be slightly soupier than you think!</li>
        <li><strong>Serving</strong>: Remove from the stove, then give it a good stir and ladle into bowls. Sprinkle with parmesan and a little parsley if using, then devour!</li>
